# Spicetify-Nord-theme
A spicetify theme that I based off of the Nord theme color palette.

I don't like it when the spicetify changes the player bar, and makes it difficult to click the scrubber ball / bar without accidentally clicking something else.

So basically, this is just a few custom colors combined with the near entire user.css stolen from the Black theme.

Point is to stay as close to the default spotify as possible, just with Nord colors.
